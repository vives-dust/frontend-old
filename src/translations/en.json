The idea is that everyone who needs a soil moisture sensor can use our open source schematics to make their own hardware. Then add a device to our user-friendly website, and you should be good to go. Data flows from your device directly to our site where you can see all data that comes from your device. Even placed in interactive graphs and everything! ",
