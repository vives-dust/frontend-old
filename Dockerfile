# Stop at a specific build stageðŸ”—
# When you build your image, you donâ€™t necessarily need to build the entire Dockerfile
# including every stage. You can specify a target build stage.
# The following command assumes you are using the previous Dockerfile but
# stops at the stage.
#
# development-stage is also build when targetting production-stage.
# I think order here matters !
